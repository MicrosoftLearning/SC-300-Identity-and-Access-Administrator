# Lab 13 - Implement and test a conditional access policy

## Lab scenario

Your organization needs to be able to limit user access to its internal applications. You must deploy an Microsoft Entra conditional access policy.

**Note** - For Conditional Access Policies, you can turn off Security Defaults, the key points to remember are from the training.  Additional information on Security defaults can be found at this link: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults>

#### Estimated time: 30 minutes

### Exercise 1 - Set a conditional access policy to block DebraB from accessing Sway

#### Task 1 -- Confirm DebraB has access to Sway


1. Launch a new InPrivate browser window.
2. Connect to [https://www.office.com](https://www.office.com) 
3. When prompted, log in as DebraB:

   | Setting | Value |
   | :--- | :--- |
   | Username | **DebraB@** `<<your lab domain>>.onmicrosoft.com` |
   | Password | Enter the admin password of the tenant(Refer the Lab Resources tab to retrieve the tenant's admin password). |
    
4. Select on the **Sway** icon to see that it loads correctly.

#### Task 2 -  Create a conditional access policy

Microsoft Entra conditional access is an advanced feature of Microsoft Entra ID that allows you to specify detailed policies that control who can access your resources. Using Conditional Access, you can protect your applications by limiting users' access based on things like groups, device type, location, and role.

1. Browse to [https://entra.microsoft.com](https://entra.microsoft.com) and sign in using a Global administrator account for the directory.

2. Open the portal menu and then select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

3. On the menu, under **Identity**, select **Protection**.

4. On the Security page, in the left navigation, select **Conditional access**.

5. On the **Overview (Preview)**, click **+ Create new policy**.

6. In the **Name** box, enter **Block Sway for DebraB**.

   **Note** - Using this naming to help you quickly recognize the policy and its function.

7. Under **Assignments**, select **0 users and groups selected**.

#### Task 3 - Test the conditional access policy

You should test your conditional access policies to ensure they working as expected.

1. Open a new 'InPrivate' browser tab and then browse to [https://sway.office.com](https://sway.office.com).
    - When prompted, log in as DebraB:

   | Setting | Value |
   | :--- | :--- |
   | Username | **DebraB@** `<<your lab domain>>.onmicrosoft.com` |
   | Password | Enter the admin password of the tenant(Refer the Lab Resources tab to retrieve the tenant's admin password). |
     
2. Verify you are prevented from accessing Microsoft Sway.

3. If you are signed in, close the tab, wait 1 minute, and then retry.
    
   **Note** - If you are auto-logged into Sway as DebraB, then you will need to manually log out.  Your credentials / access were cached.  Once you log out and sign-in, your Sway session should deny access.

4. Close the tab and return to the Conditional Access page.

5. Select the **Block Sway for DebraB** policy.

6. Under **Enable policy**, select **Off** and then select **Save**.

### Exercise 2 - Test conditional access policies with "What if"

1. On the menu, under **Identity**, select **Protection**.

1. On the Security page, in the left navigation, select **Conditional access**.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Policies**.

1. Select **What if**. You will be provided with a report at the bottom of the tile for **Policies that will apply** and **Policies that will not apply**.

This allows you to test the policies and their affectiveness before enabling the policies.

### Exercise 3 - Configure sign in frequency controls using a conditional access policy

#### Task - Use the Microsoft Entra admin center to configure conditional access

As part of your company's larger security configuration, you must test a conditional access policy that can be used to control sign in frequency

1. Browse to [https://entra.microsoft.com](https://entra.microsoft.com) and sign in using a Global administrator account for the directory.

   **NOTE** - Report-only mode is a new Conditional Access policy state that allows administrators to evaluate the impact of Conditional Access policies before enabling them in their environment. With the release of report-only mode:
    
- Conditional Access policies can be enabled in report-only mode.
- During sign-in, policies in report-only mode are evaluated but not enforced.
- Results are logged in the Conditional Access and Report-only tabs of the Sign-in log details.
- Customers with an Azure Monitor subscription can monitor the impact of their Conditional Access policies using the Conditional Access insights workbook.
