# Lab 27 - Microsoft Sentinel Kusto Queries for Azure AD data sources

**Note** - This lab requires an Azure Pass. Please see lab 00 for directions.

## Lab scenario

Microsoft Sentinel is Microsoft's cloud-native SIEM and SOAR solution.  Through connecting data sources from Microsoft and third-party security solutions, you have the ability to execute security operations tasks.  In this lab exercise, you will create a Microsoft Sentinel workspace with data connectors to Azure AD for executing hunting queries using Kusto Query Language (KQL). 

#### Estimated time: 30 minutes

### Exercise 1 - Configure Microsoft Sentinel for Kusto Queries

#### Task 1 - Create a Microsoft Sentinel workspace

1. Sign in to the [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) as a Global administrator.

1. Search for and then select **Microsoft Sentinel**. 

1. Select **Create Microsoft Sentinel**.

1. In the **Add Microsoft Sentinel to a workspace** tile, select **Create a new workspace**.

1. In **Resource group**, select **Create new** and enter **Sentinel-RG**.

1. Name the workspace.  Example - SentinelLogAnalytics.

1. Select a Region close to you.

1. Select **Review + Create** and then **Create**.

1. After the Log Analytics workspace deployment completes, click **Refresh**, then select your workspace and select **Add**.  This will add the workspace to Microsoft Sentinel and open Microsoft Sentinel.

1. If prompted, select **OK** to activate the Microsoft Sentinel free trial activated.

#### Task 2 - Add Azure AD as a Data source

1. In **Microsoft Sentinel**, navigate on the menu to **Configuration** and select **Data connectors**.

1. In the list of Data connectors, locate **Azure Active Directory** and select.

1. To the right, a preview tile will open.  Select **Open connector page**.

1. In the connector page, the instructions and next steps will be provided for the data connector. Verify that a check-mark is next to each of the **Prerequisites** to continue with the **Configuration**.

1. Under **Configuration**, check the boxes for **Sign-in logs** and **Audit logs**. Additional log sources are available but are currently in **Preview** and out of scope for this course.

1. Select **Apply Changes**. 

1. Notification will be provided that the changes were applied successfully. Navigate to the **Microsoft Sentinel** workspace by selecting the **X** on the top right of the connector page.

1. Select **Refresh** on the **Microsoft Sentinel | Data connectors** tile and the number 1 will show in the **Connected** count.

   **Note** - The Azure AD data connector may take a few minutes to show in the active count. 

#### Task 3 - Run Kusto query on User activity

1. In **Microsoft Sentinel**, navigate to **Logs** under the **General** menu heading.

1. Close the **Welcome to Log Analytics** window.

1. A window will open with sample queries, select **Audit**, and scroll to find **User IDs**.

1. Select **Run**. 

1. This will provide a list of User IDs on Azure AD.  Since we have just created the workspace, you may not see results.  Note the format of the query.

1. Under **Threat management** in the menu, select **Hunting**. 

1. Scroll down to find the query **Anomalous sign-in location by user account and authenticating application**.  This query over Azure Active Directory sign-in considers all user sign-ins for each Azure Active Directory application and picks out the most anomalous change in location profile for a user within an individual application. The intent is to hunt for user account compromise, possibly via a specific application vector. 

1. Select **View query results** to run the query.

1. This may not provide results with the new workspace, but you now have seen how queries can be run to gather information or for hunting potential threats.
