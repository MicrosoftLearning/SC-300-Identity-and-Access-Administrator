# Lab 29: Assign Azure AD roles in Privileged Identity Management

## Lab scenario

With Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), a Global administrator can make permanent Azure AD admin role assignments. These role assignments can be created using the Azure portal or using PowerShell commands.

The Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) service also allows Privileged role administrators to make permanent admin role assignments. Additionally, Privileged role administrators can make users eligible for Azure AD admin roles. An eligible administrator can activate the role when they need it, and then their permissions expire once they're done.

#### Estimated time: 15 minutes
