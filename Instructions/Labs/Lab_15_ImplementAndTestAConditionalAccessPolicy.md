# Lab 15 - Implement and test a conditional access policy

## Lab scenario

Your organization needs to be able to limit user access to its internal applications. You must deploy an Azure Active Directory conditional access policy.

#### Estimated time: 12 minutes

## Exercise 1 - Set a conditional access policy to block DebraB from accessing Yammer

### Task 1 -- Confirm DebraB has access to Yammer

1. Launch a new InPrivate browser window.
2. Connect to [https://www.office.com](https://www.office.com) 
3. When prompted, log in as DebraB:

    | Setting | Value |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | Username | **DebraB@** `<<your lab domain>>.onmicrosoft.com` |
    | Password | password provided to you |
    
    **Note** - Replace the organization-domain-name with your domain name.
    
4. Click on the Yammer icon to see that it loads correctly.

## Task 2 -  Create a conditional access policy

Azure Active Directory conditional access is an advanced feature of Azure AD that allows you to specify detailed policies that control who can access your resources. Using Conditional Access, you can protect your applications by limiting users' access based on things like groups, device type, location, and role.

1. Browse to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in using a Global administrator account for the directory.

2. Open the portal menu and then selectÂ **Azure Active Directory**.

3. On the Azure Active Directory blade, under **Manage**, select **Security**.

4. On the Security blade, in the left navigation, select **Conditional access**.

5. On the top menu, select **+ New policy**.

## Task 3 - Test the conditional access policy

You should test your conditional access policies to ensure they working as expected.

1. Open a new browser tab and then browse to [https://www.yammer.com/office365](https://www.yammer.com/office365).

     Your credentials should be passed through.
 
2. Verify you are prevented from successfully access Microsoft Yammer.

3. If you are signed in, close the tab, wait 1 minute, and then retry.
    
     **Note** - If your are auto-logged into Yammer as DebraB, then you will need to manually log out.  You credentials / access were cached.  Once you log out and sign-in, your Yammer session should deny access.
